<tr><td class="bigLetter">C</td><td>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Communications across the university are anchored in a foundation of trust and shared decision-making.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="bigLetter">I</td><td>
<h3>Improvement</h3>
<p>Change processes are thoughtful, diligent, and collective. Decisions are made with consideration of their impact on physical and mental health. Each person is responsible for advancing their ability to support an inclusive climate.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="bigLetter">V</td><td>
<h3>Value</h3>
<p>All educators, support staff, and student workers are valued for who they are as well as what they contribute. Responses to concerns are met thoughtfully and genuinely, grounded in an understanding that all workers have a common interest in the success of the institution.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="bigLetter">I</td><td>
<h3>Inclusion</h3>
<p>Each educator, support staff person, and student worker is respected as an integral element of the institution.</p>
</td></tr>

<tr><td class="bigLetter">C</td><td>
<h3>Collective outcomes</h3>
<p>Governance is shared across all levels of the institution. Sacrifices and supplements are apportioned equitably. We support education at all levels, with the aim of preventing and defending against attacks on our institutions.</p>

<p>With this vision, membership will grow, workers will unite, and the administration will be more responsive.  The challenges of today can become the lessons of the past. Working together, we enrich our lives and advance the educational mission of the university.</p>
 
<p>WC@SU sends out the call to all Stout workers, leads the charge through organizing and solidarity, and plants the flag for the change we need to see at all levels of education.</p>
